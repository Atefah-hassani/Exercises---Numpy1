# Exercises---Numpy1

NumPy Practice Exercises — Summary

This project contains three foundational NumPy exercises designed to build confidence with array operations, matrix manipulation, and analytical filtering. Each exercise focuses on a core data‑analysis skill used in real‑world analytics and BI workflows.

1. Exercise 1 — Group Comparison (Sales Analysis)
Worked with two 1D NumPy arrays representing daily sales for two months.
Key operations included:

Element‑wise subtraction to compute daily differences

Percentage change calculation using vectorized division

Understanding how NumPy handles arithmetic across arrays

This exercise reinforces the basics of vectorized operations and comparative analysis.

2. Exercise 2 — 2D Dataset (Table‑like Data)
Used a 2D NumPy array to represent weekly sales for multiple products.
Main tasks:

Summing across rows to compute total sales per product

Summing across columns to compute total sales per week

Identifying the best‑selling product using np.argmax()

This exercise builds intuition for working with matrices and performing aggregations similar to those in spreadsheets or BI tools.

3. Exercise 3 — Analytical Filtering (Price Ranges)
Applied boolean indexing to filter product prices based on conditions.
Skills practiced:

Extracting values greater than a threshold

Filtering values within a specific range using combined conditions

Understanding how NumPy handles boolean masks

This exercise strengthens data‑cleaning and filtering techniques essential for preprocessing datasets.
